**I'm actively looking for Robotics Research/Engineer positions starting in Jan. 2024**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in the [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/) and the [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab) under the advisement of [Prof. Nicola Bezzo](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/nicola-bezzo). Before coming to UVA, I was an exchange student for my senior year of undergraduate at UC Berkeley EECS. I received my B.S. degree in Automation at the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China in 2017.

My research focuses on **adaptive motion and path planning for unmanned ground/aerial vehicles**, **transfer learning**, and **robotics system failure detection and recovery**. My collaboration works extend into the areas of **autonomous inspection**, **robotic swarms**, **cyber-physical systems (CPS) security**, and **Human-robot interaction (HRI)**. The robots listed [here](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/lab-robots) are some of the robots I worked with on a daily basis. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my work or have any questions for me.

Beyond school, I'm a big outdoor person and I like almost all kinds of sports.
