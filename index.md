## About Me <img src='assets/img/Shijie_name.png' alt='drawing' width='150px'/>

I'm a robotics software engineer at DiDi Research America, shaping the future of L4 self-driving cars by building their path-planning and decision-making systems. 

Previously, I was a research assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Virginia. I worked in the <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/"  target="_blank">Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab</a> and the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab" target="_blank">Link Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/nicola-bezzo" target="_blank">Prof. Nicola Bezzo</a>. Before coming to UVA, I was an exchange student for my senior year of undergraduate at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley EECS</a>. I received my B.S. degree in Automation at the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China.

My research focuses on <strong style="font-weight:800">adaptive motion and path planning</strong> for <strong style="font-weight:800">unmanned ground/aerial vehicles</strong>, <strong style="font-weight:700">transfer learning</strong>, and <strong style="font-weight:700">robotics system failure detection and recovery</strong>. My collaboration works extend into the areas of <strong style="font-weight:700">autonomous inspection</strong>, <strong style="font-weight:700">robotic swarms</strong>, <strong style="font-weight:700">cyber-physical systems (CPS) security</strong>, and <strong style="font-weight:700">Human-robot interaction (HRI)</strong>. The robots listed <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/lab-robots" target="_blank">here</a> are some of the robots I worked with on a daily basis. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my work or have any questions for me.

Outside of academic pursuits, I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast, enjoying a wide variety of sports.
