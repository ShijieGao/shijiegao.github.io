brief: 'In this project, I integrated phidgets boards and sensors on a unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), Clearpath Jackal. The UGV localizes itself using Li-Fi. While the vehicle autonomously wonders in the indoor environment, it senses, collects and fuses different types of data (illumination, temperature, humidity, sound, etc.,).'
