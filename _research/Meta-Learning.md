**<o>Disturbances</o>** and **<o>failures</o>** on autonomous systems may lead to **<o>unsafe</o>** conditions even after applying corrective counter-measures and adaptive techniques. Proactively **<o>predicts</o>** the future **<o>states</o>** and **<o>replan</o>** under uncertainties at **<o>runtime</o>** can effectively avoid unsafe future conditions. A **<o>Meta-Learning-based</o>** frame work is proposed so that the unmanned aerial vehicles can safely perform tasks regardless the degraded conditions.
