**<o>Disturbances</o>** and **<o>failures</o>** on autonomous systems may lead to **<o>unsafe</o>** conditions even after applying corrective counter-measures and adaptive techniques. Proactively **<o>predicts</o>** the future **<o>states</o>** and **<o>replan</o>** under uncertainties at **<o>runtime</o>** can effectively avoid unsafe future conditions. A **<o>Meta-Learning-based</o>** frame work is proposed so that the unmanned aerial vehicles can safely perform tasks regardless the degraded conditions.

This work is currently under review for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). More details will come soon.
