Hello and welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in the [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/) and the [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab) under the advisement of [Prof. Nicola Bezzo](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/nicola-bezzo). Before coming to UVA, I was an exchange student for my senior year of the undergraduate at UC Berkeley EECS. I received my B.S. degree in Automation at the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China in 2017.

My research is focused on **adaptive motion and path planning for unmanned ground/aerial vehicles**, **transfer learning**, and **robotics system failure detection and recovery**. I also have experience in **robot indoor localizaion and sensing**. Check out our lab [website](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/) to see more research works performed by my awesome labmates! Feel free to shoot me an email if you are interested in my work or have any question for me.

Beyond school, I'm a big outdoor person and I like almost all kinds of sports.

            You can notice me in the background. Boston Dynamics Spot is one of the robot that I'm working with on a daily basis (also the robots listed <a href="https://www.bezzorobotics.com/lab-robots">here</a>).

            As graduate teaching assistant, we set up the virtual simulator environments before the semester and continued supporting the lab session through out the 20 Fall. We are proud the class is a success during the COVID-19 pandemic.
