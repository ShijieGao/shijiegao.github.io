brief: 'In this work, we presented a novel framework for fully autonomous inspection in a partially known environment. A formal metric is defined for evaluating inspection photo. Our method enables robots smartly pick the best inspecting point, minimize perspective distortions, and adapts the motion plan as environment changes.'

An example of inspecting an object with a slash-shape obstacle. The robot is provided with the location and dimensions of the target without knowning the slash-shaped obstacle in front ot the surface of interest. With our approach, the ground vehicle preserves almost the entire target with minimal distortion. The obstacle appears as a thin line between the 5th and 6th stripe on the target.
